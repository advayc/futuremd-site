This past weekend, FutureMD hosted our very first event, Path2Med, and we couldnâ€™t be more thrilled with how it turned out! Over 50 incredible youth joined us to hear from our amazing guest speakers about their journeys in the medical field, and the day was filled with learning, inspiration, and valuable advice.

First and foremost, we want to express our deepest gratitude to our guest speakers, Haris Saud, Fatima Bah, Cheshta Kharbanda, and Nitya Kharidehal. Your experiences and insights gave everyone a better understanding of the challenges and rewards of pursuing a career in medicine. Thank you for taking the time to share your stories and advice with the next generation of future healthcare professionals.

We also want to give a big shoutout to HelpingHandsApp, our generous sponsor, for supporting this event. Your contribution helped us bring Path2Med to life and made the experience so much more meaningful for everyone involved.

Finally, to our attendees: thank you for showing up, engaging with the speakers, and being part of this milestone event. Seeing so many passionate and curious youth in one place truly motivates us to continue organizing more opportunities like this in the future.

Path2Med was just the beginning for FutureMD, and weâ€™re so excited to plan more events that will empower and inspire young minds. Stay tuned for updates, and we hope to see you all at the next one!

Thank you again to everyone who made this event such a successâ€”we couldnâ€™t have done it without you. ðŸ’™

With gratitude,
The FutureMD Team
